Pineapple BBQ Tofu Meal Prep

Ingredients
3/4 cup uncooked quinoa
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 zucchini chopped
1 red onion chopped
2 bell peppers chopped
salt & pepper
12 oz extra firm tofu
1/2 cup barbecue sauce (plus extra to drizzle)
8 pineapple rings

Pineapple BBQ Tofu Bowls are a vegan meal prep option that you can cook on the grill! Sweet, tangy, and a healthy lunch to stock up your fridge

Itâ€™s summer, and I want to grill alllll the things! Mostly because we just purchased a new grill this year and it has been so much fun playing around with it.

Weâ€™ve been eating a lot of grilled tofu lately. Tofu has been one of those ingredients that I want to love. Itâ€™s really filling and really affordable, but I also find it can often be bland. Itâ€™s really hard to get it just right!

For this recipe, I went super simple and just slathered the tofu in BBQ sauce. Canâ€™t go wrong with that, right? The barbecue sauce + pineapple is such a great flavor combo and is really tasty in these lunch bowls as well!
